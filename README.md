## MergeSort

This is a program that implements the merge sort method on a randomly generated array of a size determined by the user. 

The user will generate the array and then be given two options:

1. Sort the array ascendingly using a bubble sort
2. Sort the array using a merge sort

After the sort, the user will be told the exact time in milliseconds that it took for the program to sort their array, using the selected method. The user can then decide to compare the speed of the two sort methods on similar size arrays.
